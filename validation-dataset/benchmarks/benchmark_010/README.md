# Benchmark_010: Optimization of silu_double_grad Function

This benchmark evaluates the performance improvement introduced in commit [af00bec](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/af00becf582ebcd7685fa8e6b87ffb47c798c83f), where redundant computations in the `silu_double_grad` function were reduced by reusing intermediate results.

- **Commit:** [af00bec](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/af00becf582ebcd7685fa8e6b87ffb47c798c83f)
- **Author:** HydrogenSulfate
- **Optimization:** Reduced redundant computations by reusing intermediate results.

## Benchmark Goal

Assess the performance impact of reducing redundant computations in the `silu_double_grad` function.

## Optimization Type

- **Category:** Execution Time Inefficiency
- **Rationale:** The original implementation performs redundant multiplications involving the sigmoid value. The optimized version caches intermediate results to avoid recomputation, reducing CPU overhead and improving performance.
