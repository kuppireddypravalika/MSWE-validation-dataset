Subject: [PATCH] Avoid foreach on STL container

Don't use foreach in GroundControlPointsHelper. The container this is
operating on is an STL container, not a Qt container, which is very,
very bad... or would be, if qtExtensions didn't replace Qt's foreach
with a range-based for. At any rate, we should be avoiding foreach these
days.
