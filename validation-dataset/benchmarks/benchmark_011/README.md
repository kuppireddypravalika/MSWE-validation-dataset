# Benchmark 011: Median Filter Optimization Using `std::nth_element`

This benchmark evaluates the performance impact of replacing `std::partial_sort` with `std::nth_element` in the median filter implementation of the Point Cloud Library (PCL).

- **Commit:** [8c968e0](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/commit/8c968e0742352b4a6b66c486494f4ff29af071c7)
- **Author:** mvieth
- **Optimization:** Use `std::nth_element` instead of `std::partial_sort` to compute the median more efficiently.

## Benchmark Goal

Assess the performance improvement achieved by using `std::nth_element` for median computation in a sliding window over a 2D grid.

### Inefficiency Classification

- **Type:** Execution-time inefficiency
- **Reason:** The original implementation used `std::partial_sort` to compute the median, which has higher computational complexity than necessary. Replacing it with `std::nth_element` reduces the time complexity, leading to improved performance.
