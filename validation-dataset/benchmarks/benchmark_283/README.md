# Benchmark 283: Range-based Loop Conversion in PCL

This benchmark is derived from the PointCloudLibrary commit [a0c99ce](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/commit/a0c99cea67e738ef48e6623b3eff16205a309bce) which replaced classic iterator loops with range-based for loops in `pcl::KdTreeFLANN::convertCloudToArray`.

- **Optimization:** Use range-based for loops with `const int&` instead of iterator based loops.
- **Expected Benefit:** Minor reduction of loop overhead when copying point cloud data.
- **Commit Author:** SunBlack

## Benchmark Description

The benchmark models the conversion of a point cloud into a contiguous float array. The original version iterates using explicit iterators over an index vector, dereferencing each element. The optimized version uses a range-based loop avoiding repeated dereferencing and unnecessary copies. Both perform validity checks and vectorize point coordinates into a preallocated buffer.

## Inefficiency Classification

- **Type:** Execution-time inefficiency
- **Reason:** Extra iterator dereference and index copying inside a tight loop.
