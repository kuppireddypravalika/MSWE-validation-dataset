	 * A bit of discussion is warranted on this:

	 * empty are freed.  It's also possible to set the expected lengths
	 * first (and only allocate
	 * 	roundup(rlen, BUFFER_SEGMENT_SIZE) / BUFFER_SEGMENT_SIZE
	 * BufferSegments, though really IOV_MAX (or some chosen number) seems
	 * a bit better since most of our reads right now are read_amount_==0)
	 * and put them into a Buffer and trim the leftovers, which is a bit
	 * nicer.
	 *
	 * Since our read_amount_ is usually 0, though, we're kind of at the
	 * mercy chance (well, not really) as to how much data we will read,
	 * which means a sizable amount of thrashing of memory; allocating and
	 * freeing BufferSegments.
	 *
	 * By comparison, stack space is cheap in userland and allocating 64K
	 * of it here is pretty painless.  Reading to it is fast and then
	 * copying only what we need into BufferSegments isn't very costly.
	 * Indeed, since readv can't sparsely-populate each data pointer, it
	 * has to do some data shuffling, already.  Benchmarking would be a
	 * good idea, but it seems like there are arguments both ways.  Of
	 * course, tack is very fast and this code path hasn't been thrashed
	 * half so much.  When tack is adjusted to use the IO system and Pipes
	 * in the future, if performance degradation is noticeable, perhaps
	 * it will worth it to switch.  For now, absence any idea of the real
	 * read sizes in the wild, doing nothing and not thrashing memory is
	 * decidedly more appealing.
