Subject: [PATCH] Initialise variable to shut up compiler warning

This variable is always initialised by LinearAlg2D::getDist2FromLineSegment before it is used. But the compiler can't detect that it is, because it noticed that the variable is not changed in some cases (namely if the pointer is null). So this just shuts up the compiler.
