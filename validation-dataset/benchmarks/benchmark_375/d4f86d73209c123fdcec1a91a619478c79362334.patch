Subject: [PATCH] Add SunCC code path to GetAlignmentOf It looks like
 GetAlignmentOf was returning the "UnsignedMin(4U, sizeof(T))" for SunCC. It
 was causing SIGBUSes on Sparc when T=word64. OpenCSW provided access to their
 build farm and we were able to test "__alignof__(T)" back to an early SunCC
 on Solaris 9.
