Subject: [PATCH] [surface] used & instead of listing all captures. initial
 compilation errors led me to believe that I needed to list all captures, but
 now that those other errors have been ironed out, @kunaltyagi and @morwenn
 have pointed out that that was unnecessary and is in fact computationally
 wasteful.
