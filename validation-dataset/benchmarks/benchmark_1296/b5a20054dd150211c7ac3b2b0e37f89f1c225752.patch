Subject: [PATCH] mostly cosmetic (I think) - but may have some performance
 implications (some +, some -) - use much more for (const T& or for (const
 auto& - replacing just for (T, or other things less clear / appropriate;
 haven't found clear docs on web about universally what is best here, but I if
 performance diff unclear (less a win for Stroika than other systems due to
 COW and maybe more cost due to how iterators return by value not reference)
