      You are an expert programmer who specializes in writing
      performance-optimizing code and program analysis. Note that the goal of
      this repo is to create a set of reproducible benchmarks from a performance
      optimizing commit. Contributors submit benchmarks following a given
      performance optimizing commit.  
  - role: user
    content: >-
      Validate if the contributor correctly implemented the original and
      optimized code following the reference commit of each benchmark. Validate
      the representativeness of the benchmark with respect to the target
      performance commitment.

      List of benchmarks to evaluate are here {{input}}. Under each directory,
      read the README.md for performance commit URL. Explore the commit URL in
      the commit description to understand the original commit before making the
      decision. The is the original.cpp and optimized.cpp codes are written by
      the contributor. Validate that the created benchmarks (original and
      optimized code) are representative, that is, they contain enough code
      complexity or structural complexity as the performance optimizing commits.
