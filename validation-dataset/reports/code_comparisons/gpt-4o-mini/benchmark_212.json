  "additional_insights": "Optimizing parallel tasks should consider both the overhead of thread management and the size of tasks to balance load among threads. The LLM's approach is more scalable, as it can adapt to varying hardware specifications, whereas the hand-optimized code may perform better for small to medium workloads on systems with a consistent number of available threads.",
