  "additional_insights": "The LLM implementation's optimization focuses on more efficient computations by leveraging bit manipulation, which can often yield better performance, especially in scenarios where mathematical precision is maintained. Overall, the combination of both optimizations (handling both integer and floating-point efficiently) would likely yield the best results.",
