This might be due to a focus on maintaining the overall structure and behavior of the original code rather than applying aggressive simplifications.",
  "additional_insights": "The hand optimized version effectively reduces the number of evaluations by short-circuiting when constants are involved, providing a significant performance boost in scenarios where these conditions are frequently met. Future optimizations could explore more extensive persistence or reuse of expressions to minimize repeated allocations and evaluations.",
