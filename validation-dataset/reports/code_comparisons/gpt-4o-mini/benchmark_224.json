The hand-optimized version introduced a specific early-return check for Windows, which directly improves performance in certain environments. Additionally, the LLM emphasizes thread-safe optimizations that prevent unnecessary processing after locking, showcasing a trade-off between universal optimizations and specific platform checks.",
