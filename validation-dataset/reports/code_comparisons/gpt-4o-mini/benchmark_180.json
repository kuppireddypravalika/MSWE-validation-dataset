  "additional_insights": "While the LLM implementation is effective through parallelism and processing speed increases, the hand-tuned method takes advantage of specific hardware optimizations that can significantly enhance performance for large matrices. Incorporating techniques like blocking can lead to more efficient memory access patterns, especially in the context of cache memory.",
