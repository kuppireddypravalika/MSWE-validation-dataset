It could also prioritize code readability and maintainability over speed, leading to the omission of the more complex Newton's method.",
  "additional_insights": "While the LLM version maintains the structural integrity of the original algorithm by using the Brent bisection method, the hand-optimized version successfully transitions to a method that offers quadratic convergence, which is generally more efficient for single-variable root-finding problems, especially when a good initial guess is available.",
