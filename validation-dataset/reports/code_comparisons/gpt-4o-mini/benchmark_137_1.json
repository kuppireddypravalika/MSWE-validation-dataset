However, the hand optimized version retains flexibility for different use cases, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the parameters passed, which could be important in broader contexts.",

The benchmark checks for performance improvements relative to the original implementation, and even near-zero execution time in the hand optimized case indicates a significant enhancement over the baseline.",
