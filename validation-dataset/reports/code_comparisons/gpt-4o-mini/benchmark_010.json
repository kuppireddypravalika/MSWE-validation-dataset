Additionally, the LLM could have chosen to introduce new formulations that enhance gradient calculations.",
  "additional_insights": "Both hand optimization and LLM optimization aim to reduce repetitive calculations, which can significantly improve performance. The LLM approach introduces a more nuanced understanding of gradients, possibly at the cost of simplicity, while the hand optimization is more straightforward but may leave room for further enhancements in complex scenarios.",
