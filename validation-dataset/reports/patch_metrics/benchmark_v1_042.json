    "justification": "The patch indeed focuses on a performance improvement by altering the graphic measurement section to optimize the metrics retrieval with added specifications influencing faster panel drawing."

    "score": 3,
    "justification": "The benchmarking primarily functions by modifying local graphic metrics without substantial reliance on external repository context; however, the usage of GTK's Pango context integration gives slight dependency on the graphical repository."
