    "**Structural Fidelity (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 5\n- Justification: \"The benchmark maintains the same core structure and logic as the original, with the only notable change being the addition of variable ordering, which does not alter the overall flow.\"\n\n**Targeted Isolation (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 5\n- Justification: \"The benchmark strictly focuses on optimizing variable order for enumeration while avoiding unrelated code, clearly delineating the optimization target.\"\n\n**Side Effect Preservation (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 4\n- Justification: \"The transformation maintains necessary functionality, avoiding major side effects, though technically the localized handling of special cases may feel somewhat artificial.\"\n\n**Correctness and Functional Equivalence (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 5\n- Justification: \"The benchmark correctly replicates the original functionality, effectively implementing the optimization without altering intended results.\"\n\n**Computational Realism (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 4\n- Justification: \"The workload and enumeration paradigm are realistic but could benefit from more diverse data interactions to further emulate real workloads beyond just complexity considerations.\"\n\n**Context Neutrality (1-5):**\n\n- Score: 3\n- Justification: \"While not overtly biased, the function renaming and ordering logic emphasize optimization, which could give hints to reviewers, albeit indirectly against actual performance analysis.\"",
