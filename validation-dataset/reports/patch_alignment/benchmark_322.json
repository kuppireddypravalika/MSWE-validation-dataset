    "**Structural Fidelity (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"Minor indexing changes made; core loop structure preserved.\"  \n  *The benchmark retains the original implementation style and logical flow of the main function, but it slightly modifies how normalization is handled during class lookup.*\n\n**Targeted Isolation (1-5):**\n- **Score: 5**\n- **Justification:** \"Explicitly targets the FindSTLClass functionality, no unrelated functions included.\"  \n  *The validation mainly centers around the `GetClass` and related methods, focusing on the optimizations performed in the class finding capability without incorporating unrelated portions or functionalities.*\n\n**Side Effect Preservation (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"Contextual operations preserved but added focus on class generation avoids long-term effects.\"  \n  *While the benchmark modifies where class generation calls occur, it still presents most setups that maintain realistic use cases, albeit with some initialization adjustments that do not affect core functionality.*\n\n**Correctness and Functional Equivalence (1-5):**\n- **Score: 5**\n- **Justification:** \"Replicates all critical base functionality correctly.\"  \n  *The benchmark successfully mirrors the core functionalities of the original implementation, handling class finding and normalizing as intended.*\n\n**Computational Realism (1-5):**\n- **Score: 5**\n- **Justification:** \"Represents likely computation without artificial data overload.\"  \n  *The computing tasks emphasized in the benchmark are grounded in reasonable normalization adjustments typical of what might occur during execution.*\n\n**Context Neutrality (1-5):**\n- **Score: 3**\n- **Justification:** \"Current naming conventions do not clearly hint at particular optimizations yet still outlined.\"  \n  *Many identifiers remain neutral, although changes to how STL classes are generated provide some implicit suggestions about the focus on optimization without concrete bias in naming or comments.*",
