    "Certainly! Below is my evaluation based on the given dimensions, focused on the benchmark `benchmark_104`, with step-by-step reasoning and justifications for each:\n\n### Structural Fidelity (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark preserves the original code's structure and logic precisely, with just a semantic adjustment for candidate selection.\"\n\n### Targeted Isolation (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark isolates the specific functionality of selecting a candidate array, clearly delineating from unrelated code and behaviors.\"\n\n### Side Effect Preservation (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark maintains all relevant functional dependencies, providing realistic context and avoiding artificial code that exaggerates or distracts from true context.\"\n\n### Correctness and Functional Equivalence (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark accurately replicates the original functionality in terms of its logic, ensuring computations behave as expected.\"\n\n### Computational Realism (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark is grounded in realistic scenarios typical of the processing of multidimensional arrays, adhering to practical computational characteristics.\"\n\n### Context Neutrality (1-5)\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"Variable and function names follow conventional standards without implying hints towards specific optimizations or biases that might affect perception.\"\n\nThese evaluations affirm that the benchmark `benchmark_104` effectively captures the original code's function with high fidelity while isolating the optimization focus.",
