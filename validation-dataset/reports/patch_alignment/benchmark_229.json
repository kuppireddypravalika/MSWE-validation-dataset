    "**Structural Fidelity (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"Original structure largely preserved, with changes mostly confining to memory allocation methods and minimal refactoring.\"\n\n**Targeted Isolation (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"Benchmark focuses on cache allocation and usage, but also retains unrelated logging functionality not essential to optimization.\"\n\n**Side Effect Preservation (1-5):**\n- **Score: 3**\n- **Justification:** \"While it removes excessive logging in some sections, unnecessary logging of state and flow still permeates.\"\n\n**Correctness and Functional Equivalence (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"Replicates original functionality well, but memory allocations and deallocations may introduce minor state inconsistencies under full load.\"\n\n**Computational Realism (1-5):**\n- **Score: 4**\n- **Justification:** \"The benchmark reflects a realistic computational workload for cache management but may enable paths that will rarely execute in typical situations.\"\n\n**Context Neutrality (1-5):**\n- **Score: 3**\n- **Justification:** \"While most naming adheres to an expected technical format, some variable names hint at specific optimization goals, exposing intentional targets.\" \n\nThis assessment emphasizes that while 'benchmark_229' strives to maintain the core of the original implementation, minor deviations, added complexity in logging, and areas of potential misalignment arose during transformation that may impact fidelity to its structural and functional intents. The evaluation recognizes the value of tuning crucial pathways without granular errors disrupting fundamental properties of the code, striving for importance over minutiae relative to optimized dimensions."
