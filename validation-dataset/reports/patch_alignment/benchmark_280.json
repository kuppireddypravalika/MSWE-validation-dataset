    "### Structural Fidelity (1-5):\n- **Score: 4**  \n- **Justification:** \"The original nested loops for accessing elements have been converted into a formulaic index calculation, maintaining the overall loop structure but losing some of the original array access mechanism.\"\n\n### Targeted Isolation (1-5):\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"Directly focuses on computation of the sums using the externally defined addition, isolating the optimization to the sum computation without extraneous logic.\"\n\n### Side Effect Preservation (1-5):\n- **Score: 4**  \n- **Justification:** \"Although the optimization removes dependencies on unused array access, it still accurately reflects realistic and usable computations based on the structure seen in the original code.\"\n\n### Correctness and Functional Equivalence (1-5):\n- **Score: 4**  \n- **Justification:** \"While the structure alters, the functionality remains intact as it replicates the summation process, albeit with differences in index computation which marginally modifies performance features.\"\n\n### Computational Realism (1-5):\n- **Score: 5**  \n- **Justification:** \"Accurately simulates realistic workloads by computing sums in a nested loop structure, matching typical data manipulation seen within optimization tasks.\"\n\n### Context Neutrality (1-5):\n- **Score: 3**  \n- **Justification:** \"Naming conventions are neutral but slight restructuring could be seen as intentional by hinting at optimizing array accesses and external function calls.\"",
