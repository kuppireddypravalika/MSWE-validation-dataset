  "What is the size and structure of the 'rom' vector being passed to the function?",
  "Are there any common use cases or patterns for the data stored in the secure area that can be leveraged for optimization?",
  "Could the use of a pointer or reference instead of copying large blocks of memory improve performance?",
  "Is there a need for the ARRAY_SIZE macro, or would a more direct approach to calculating array sizes be clearer and potentially more efficient?",
  "Could additional checks be implemented upfront to possibly short-circuit the verification process and enhance efficiency?"
