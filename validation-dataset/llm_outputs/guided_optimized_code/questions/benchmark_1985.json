  "1. What is the frequency of function calls for the 'step' function, and how does it affect performance?",
  "2. Are there any opportunities to replace repeated calculations within the loops with precomputed values?",
  "3. How can vectorization or parallelization techniques be applied to optimize the nested loops for performance?",
  "4. Is it beneficial to use references or pointers instead of copying for large data structures like 'state_type'?",
  "5. Can any compiler optimization flags or settings be utilized to enhance the performance of this code?"
