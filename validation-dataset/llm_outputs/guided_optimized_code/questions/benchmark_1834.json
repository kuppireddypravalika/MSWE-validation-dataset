  "Are there performance bottlenecks when accessing or modifying elements of the matrix?",
  "Could we use a different data structure or memory layout for better cache performance?",
  "Is there an opportunity to reduce the number of passes through the data, such as combining the summation with multiplication?",
  "Have we considered using parallelization techniques for matrix operations to improve speed?"
