  "What is the size of the 'width' parameter, and how often does the 'compute_mipmap_offset' function get called in the application?",
  "Are there any known constraints on the input values for 'width' that could allow for simplifications or optimizations?",
  "Is the performance critical inside the 'compute_mipmap_offset' function, or is it acceptable if it runs slightly slower if the code becomes more readable?",
  "Could the bit operation in 'uilog2' be replaced with a more efficient algorithm, such as using built-in functions or lookup tables?",
  "Would it be beneficial to consider alternative data types or constants, such as using larger or smaller types for 'bytespp' or the 'size' variable to reduce computations?"
