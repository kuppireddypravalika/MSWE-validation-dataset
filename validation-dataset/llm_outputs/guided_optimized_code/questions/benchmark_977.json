  "What is the expected input size and range of characters for the conversion function?",
  "Is there a specific performance target (e.g., execution time) we want to achieve with the optimized code?",
  "Are there any compiler optimizations or flags that are currently being used, and should we explore more aggressive optimization settings?",
  "Could we leverage any modern hardware features (like SIMD or vectorization) to speed up the conversion process?",
  "How do we measure the performance impact of the proposed optimizations to ensure they are effective?"
