  "analysis": "The optimized code leverages OpenMP for parallel execution and SIMD directives in the distance computation to enhance performance. The distance function has been augmented for vectorization, and the loop structure in compute_distance_matrix has been refined to directly access only the upper triangle of the distance matrix, eliminating unnecessary calculations. This ensures better cache locality and reduces synchronization overhead, resulting in significantly faster execution times."
