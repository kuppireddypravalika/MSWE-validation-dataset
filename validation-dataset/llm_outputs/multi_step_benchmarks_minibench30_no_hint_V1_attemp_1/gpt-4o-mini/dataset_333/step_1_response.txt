  "analysis": "Optimizations focus on eliminating the mutex in `Grid` class in favor of `std::once_flag` for thread-safe initialization, which reduces overhead. The `findIntersectingCells` method now initializes `build_aabb_tree` only once across all threads. Additionally, the vectors were restructured to avoid dynamic memory allocations in parallel regions, potentially reducing memory contention and improving cache performance. The overall loop remains parallelized, enhancing compute efficiency."
