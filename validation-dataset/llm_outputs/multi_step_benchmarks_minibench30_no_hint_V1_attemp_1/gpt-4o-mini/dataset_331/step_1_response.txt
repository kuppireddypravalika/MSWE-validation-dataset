  "analysis": "The code has been optimized to reduce overhead by using an iterator for traversing the vector rather than indexing into it directly, which helps with potential cache locality. Additionally, the calculation of the current time is done by using the pre-calculated midpoint rather than converting it repeatedly. This ensures that we avoid calling mktime redundantly, thus improving performance. The overall structure remains the same, preserving the original behavior while enhancing performance."
