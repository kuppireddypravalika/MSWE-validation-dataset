  "prompt": "You are an expert C++ performance engineer. Optimize the provided code for high compute and resource performance while preserving behavior. The optimized function must keep the exact same signature as the hand-written implementation. Use this signature:\n<function_signature>\n\nIf the original code includes explicit template instantiation statements, reproduce them unchanged at the end of the optimized file.\n\nRespond only with a JSON object containing the optimized implementation. Use the key \"optimized_code\". Additional source files may be provided for context. Here are the files:\n\n<original_code>",
