https://github.com/Ristellise/AegisubDC/commit/7c461ddfcf4a1531f66fec84dd94ab77f5d0a68e,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"Optimization (changing loop index type from int64_t to size_t) showed negligible performance improvement (<0.1%) even on a 32-bit Docker environment. Modern CPUs and compilers mitigate the original arithmetic overhead targeted by this optimization, making this benchmark unsuitable for demonstrating meaningful performance improvements in a contemporary benchmark suite.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting only if benchmarking older architectures.
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/2552742f6aea9db96d76c40a556cbf94762da7b6,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The optimization replaces a custom ReduceKernel call with a higher-level phi::ReduceSum abstraction. However, benchmarking shows inconsistent performance improvements around the 1% threshold, with some runs failing to meet the minimum CI requirement. The change targets execution-time inefficiency by simplifying reduction logic, but its real benefit may only emerge in large-scale tensor workloads or hardware-accelerated (GPU) deployments where the abstraction enables internal kernel fusion.",Exclude from benchmark suite. May be revisited for benchmarks involving large tensors or GPU-optimized pipelines.,execution-time
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/b728057ad94a1b179e57611258b5d6614e1dbb3f,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The optimization moves `GetKernelInfo()` into the thread to speed up compilation. However, this reordering changes final output values in our benchmark simulation. The benchmark fails correctness checks and does not meet reproducibility criteria.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting if numerical equivalence can be preserved.,execution-time
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/commit/e8831ac954e2e1404029eb550f5ba2675a3dd061,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit adds a third operand to a vector of inputs passed to symbolic shape inference. It is a functional extension or bug fix, not a performance optimization.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Not performance-related.,
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle-Lite/commit/00372d1e10b96d9ebd9d6432a2c84b26e6f92314,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit removes a strict layout check (`ldc == N`) in the `M == 1` path of sgemm to fix a performance regression and ensure the sgemv path is taken more often. While it targets a valid edge-case optimization, our benchmark results showed highly variable and low improvement (~0–2%), failing to meet inclusion criteria.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting if more stable performance improvements can be demonstrated under varied matrix sizes or ARM-specific conditions.,execution-time
https://github.com/Raptor3um/raptoreum/commit/9c1e5bc2b74ea0f63bae1b8dac0bfffe3609a223,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit replaces a postfix increment (`ret++`) with a prefix increment (`++ret`) in `base_uint::operator-()`. While semantically equivalent and slightly more efficient, benchmarking shows no measurable performance gain even with large iteration counts. The optimization is too minor to justify inclusion.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting only if this operation occurs frequently within a performance-critical loop such as cryptographic routines or tight arithmetic kernels.,execution-time
https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc/commit/d216a3da284b0e3eb39a8009886024818c47c8f8,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The commit removes an unnecessary `std::move` from a return statement involving a prvalue. This is a semantic cleanup with no measurable impact on performance or runtime behavior, and thus does not qualify as a performance optimization.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider accepting only if the change demonstrably improves runtime or resource usage.,execution-time
https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc/commit/5426bc402feb201cbb7b3d14c73dc4b251d50953,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit only replaces a C-style cast with static_cast. It does not change control flow, algorithm, or runtime behavior, and generates identical machine code in practice. As such, it offers no measurable performance improvement and cannot pass the CI threshold for benchmark inclusion.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Useful for code quality or safety checks, but not suitable for performance benchmarking.,execution-time
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/617a488a0a775b4b433fc89fc79f2ee909f60477,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The commit changes the variable type from size_t to u64 to match the return type of the read function. This is a type consistency correction without any impact on performance, as it doesn't alter the logic or introduce algorithmic changes.",Exclude from benchmark suite. The change is a non-functional correction and doesn't warrant performance benchmarking.,execution-time
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/2f329cf7b59bed4d674948d695fd0f8267c390b0,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The optimization targets a specific reservation bit condition that is rarely triggered in the benchmark environment. As a result, the added logic introduces overhead without demonstrating measurable benefit. The current benchmark setup cannot capture the real-world contention this change is designed to optimize.",Exclude from benchmark suite.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/a2e8e3090c992402fb8723761319cb03e4b5f9ef,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The optimization introduces a fast-match path to avoid fallback vector operations in FSM, but the performance difference is negligible. Despite using 100% match ratio and increased fallback complexity, the optimized path fails to produce ≥1% speedup and occasionally performs worse. This makes it unsuitable for inclusion in the benchmark suite under current conditions.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting only if FSM workloads dominate runtime in future profiling.,execution-time
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/e5d0e035d0b6358b154242ffd3a5d7b5622ff496,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"The optimization reorders FM instruction logic to improve instruction-level parallelism via LLVM’s out-of-order execution paths. However, the benchmark runs as scalar C++ and does not involve LLVM IR or SPU JIT, resulting in no measurable performance benefit. The current infrastructure cannot replicate the intended execution context.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Revisit only with LLVM JIT or SPU vector backend simulation.,execution-time
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/813f7b50c14ea02e511fed5d0534a74ffa3630e8,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"Although the commit optimizes SIMD shuffle behavior to emit cheaper AVX-512 blend instructions instead of VPERMI2W, the change alters the output values due to a different shuffle mask. This violates the benchmark suite's requirement for identical output, making it unsuitable for inclusion as a valid benchmark.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting if the suite supports relaxed correctness or instruction-level profiling in future.,execution-time

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/7ce790f36988bac09813bf9b10ce3be4ebfabffb,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit disables AVX instructions for GCC/Clang builds by restricting them to MSVC-only to avoid fallback to 128-bit SSE instructions, which can be slower in practice. However, our benchmark results show that the fallback SSE path consistently underperforms compared to the original AVX-optimized path, providing no measurable runtime improvement. The benchmark is thus excluded for lacking clear performance benefits. Reconsider only if future compiler toolchains or runtime configurations can better utilize the fallback SSE path.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Consider revisiting if fallback behavior improves for broader compiler compatibility.,execution-time
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/17c8b340883dad5e1810062ff309979f394d3b1a,Pravalika Kuppireddy,"This commit adds a conditional to avoid unnecessary atomic operations, aiming to improve performance in low-contention scenarios. However, the benchmark shows that the added branch introduces overhead, resulting in the optimized version performing slower than the original under current conditions. The benchmark does not demonstrate consistent runtime improvements or real-world performance gains. Reconsider only if tested in environments with significant thread contention where the atomic avoidance logic can provide clear benefits.",Exclude from benchmark suite. Re-evaluate only in high-contention environments that reflect intended optimization context.,resource
